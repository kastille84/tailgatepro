## Phase 0 — Foundations · status: code complete (manual device smokes + pwa_icon.jpg cleanup pending)

- [x] 0a. Register the service worker via `virtual:pwa-register` in `client/src/main.tsx`
      (guarded to production so it is a no-op in dev and tests)
- [x] 0a. Add a `manifest` to the `VitePWA` config in `client/vite.config.ts`
- [x] 0a. Add `<meta name="theme-color">` + Apple web-app meta to `client/index.html`
      (the `<link rel="manifest">` is injected by `vite-plugin-pwa`)
- [x] 0a. Add `client/src/vite-env.d.ts` referencing `vite-plugin-pwa/client` for `registerSW` types
- [x] 0a. PWA icon set: `@vite-pwa/assets-generator` (dev dep) + `client/pwa-assets.config.ts`
      (`minimal-2023` preset) generates `pwa-64/192/512`, `maskable-icon-512x512`,
      `apple-touch-icon-180x180`, `favicon.ico` into `client/public/` from the 1024² master
      `client/public/logo.png`. Wired via `pwaAssets: { config: true }` in `client/vite.config.ts`
      (`includeHtmlHeadLinks`/`injectThemeColor` off — head `<link>`s are hand-written in
      `index.html`); the master is kept out of the SW precache via `injectManifest.globIgnores:
["logo.png"]`. Old Leaflyt `favicon.svg` deleted. Generated icons are committed under
      `client/public/`.
- [x] 0a. Build verified: `dist/manifest.webmanifest` lists the 4 PNG icons (64/192/512 +
      maskable), `dist/index.html` has one each of icon / apple-touch-icon / theme-color / manifest
      link (no duplicates), `dist/service-worker.js` precache is 13 entries / ~1.2 MB
- [x] 0a. Manual smoke on a device: `npm run build && npm run preview` (HTTPS via basic-ssl),
      install the PWA, reload offline, confirm the shell renders. LAN device: `preview -- --host`.
- [x] 0a. Housekeeping: a stray `client/public/pwa_icon.jpg` (563 KB) was added alongside the
      master — remove it if it is not needed (it is copied into `dist/` but not used)
- [x] 0b. `ui_comps/modal/` — hand-rolled portal dialog (Esc + overlay close, focus trap,
      focus restore, `role="dialog"`/`aria-modal`) + test.
      Note: built with `react-dom` `createPortal` instead of the untyped `react-modal` dep.
- [x] 0b. `ui_comps/spinner/` + test
- [x] 0b. `ui_comps/checkbox/` + test
- [x] 0b. `ui_comps/radio/` (`RadioGroup` + `Radio`) + test
- [x] 0b. `ui_comps/select/` + test
- [x] 0c. Document the data-access model in `docs/data-access.md` (server-brokered, RLS deny-all)
- [x] 0d. PWA install UX — a Navbar "Install app" button that fires the native prompt on
      Chromium and opens platform-specific instructions everywhere else: - `client/src/utils/pwa.ts` — `initInstallCapture()` (module singleton for the
      `beforeinstallprompt` event, wired in `main.tsx`), `isStandalone()`, `detectPlatform()`,
      `getInstallability()`. - `client/src/interfaces/pwa.ts` — `BeforeInstallPromptEvent`, `InstallPlatform`,
      `Installability`, `InstallGuide`. - `client/src/data/installInstructions.ts` — per-platform step copy + button/toast strings. - `client/src/context/pwa-install/` — provider/context/hook trio (mirrors `context/auth`);
      `promptInstall()`, `dismiss()`/`wasDismissed` with a 7-day localStorage TTL (reserved for
      a future banner), `appinstalled` → success toast + hide UI. - `client/src/features/pwa-install/` — `InstallButton` + `InstallInstructionsModal`
      (uses the `ui_comps/modal` primitive; adaptive glyphs). - Wired: `PwaInstallProvider` in `App.tsx`, `initInstallCapture()` in `main.tsx`,
      `<InstallButton>` in `Navbar.tsx`. `Navbar.test.tsx` stubs the feature module. - Tests: `tests/utils/pwa.test.ts` (~10 UA strings), `tests/features/pwa-install/*`,
      `tests/context/pwa-install/*`. 223 tests pass, coverage ~99%.
- [x] 0d. Manual smoke: in `npm run preview`, desktop Chrome shows a working native install
      button; an iPhone UA (DevTools emulation or a real phone) shows the Safari Share steps
      modal; a Firefox UA shows the "open in Chrome/Edge/Safari" hint.

## Phase 1 — Projects module · status: 1a + 1b + 1c code complete; end-to-end smoke pending (needs Supabase SQL applied)

- [~] Pre-req: confirm `Supabase_SQL.sql` (projects, project_subcontractors, enums) applied
  — cannot verify from the codebase; run it against Supabase before hitting the endpoints
- [x] Housekeeping: `docs/Supabase_Schema.md` `projects` table was stale (`gc_id`); updated to
      match `Supabase_SQL.sql` (`owner_company_id` NOT NULL, `gc_company_id`, `gc_name_custom`,
      `created_at`, `check_gc_info` CHECK)
- [x] 1a. `usersService.getUserContext(id)` in `server/services/users.js` (+ tests in `users.test.js`)
- [x] 1a. `server/middlewares/loadUserContext.js` (+ `.test.js`) — sets `req.user = { id, companyId, role }`
- [x] 1b. `server/services/projects.js` — `listForCompany` / `create` / `update` (+ `.test.js`)
- [x] 1b. `server/controllers/projects.js` (+ `.test.js`)
- [x] 1b. `server/routes/projects.js` — GET / POST / PATCH with express-validator chains
- [x] 1b. Mount `/api/projects` in `server.js`
- [x] 1b. Manual smoke: curl the three endpoints with a real Bearer token (see plan §Verification)
- [x] 1c. `client/src/interfaces/project.ts` (`Project`, `ProjectStatus`)
- [x] 1c. `client/src/services/apiProjects.ts` (Bearer auth, client-generated UUID on create) + test
- [x] 1c. `client/src/hooks/useProjects.ts` (the app's first `useQuery`) + test
- [x] 1c. `client/src/hooks/useCreateProject.ts` / `useUpdateProject.ts` (+ `invalidateQueries(["projects"])`) + tests
- [x] 1c. `client/src/features/projects/` — `ProjectList`, `ProjectForm` (RHF+Zod, in Modal) + tests
- [x] 1c. `client/src/pages/Projects/` + `/projects` route under `RequireAuth` + Navbar link
- [x] 1c. Dashboard converted to a hub: entry-point card grid (Projects active; Toolbox Talks /
      Meeting Logs / GC Compliance "coming soon"); test updated
- [x] Confirm client coverage still ≥ 90% — `npx vitest run --coverage`: 261 tests pass, ~99.96%
- [x] Verify: create/edit a project end-to-end; row lands in Supabase with client UUID (needs SQL applied)
- [ ] `npm run build` clean — BLOCKED by a pre-existing `tsc` failure in
      `client/src/ui_comps/form/Input.tsx` (`theme.colors.concrete[300]` doesn't exist;
      `@types/react` 19 `cloneElement`/`ReactElement` unknown-typing). Unrelated to Phase 1;
      needs its own fix. `npm run lint` is clean for the Phase 1 files.

## Phase 1d — Project delete / archive · status: code complete; end-to-end smoke pending (needs `archived_at` column applied)

Decisions: guarded hard delete **+** reversible archive; any member of the
**owning** company (TODO: tighten to `admin`/`safety_manager` once roles are
real); archive from any status, restorable; archived projects hidden from the
default list.

- [x] Schema: `projects.archived_at TIMESTAMPTZ` (nullable). `Supabase_SQL.sql`
      (+ `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` note), `Supabase_Schema.md`
- [x] Server: `projects` service `remove` (409 when `meeting_logs` exist, else
      hard delete scoped to owner) + `update` `archived` alias + `listForCompany`
      `includeArchived`; controller `deleteProject` + query/body passthrough;
      `DELETE /api/projects/:id` route + `body("archived")` on PATCH (+ tests)
- [x] Client: `Project.archivedAt`; `apiProjects` `deleteProject` +
      `includeArchived` + `archived` patch key; `useDeleteProject` /
      `useArchiveProject` hooks; `useProjects(includeArchived)`; `Projects` page
      "Show archived" toggle; `ProjectList` archived badge; `ProjectForm` danger
      zone (archive/restore + delete) (+ tests)
- [x] `ui_comps/confirm-dialog/` — generic confirm-before-acting dialog (built on
      `Modal` + `Button`), used by the `ProjectForm` delete flow (+ test)
- [ ] Pre-req: apply `archived_at` to Supabase before hitting the endpoints
- [ ] Verify end-to-end: create → delete a talk-less project; archive → toggle
      "Show archived" → restore; other-company bearer token → 404
- [ ] Phase 3 offline: route archive (PATCH) and delete (DELETE) through the
      IndexedDB replay queue alongside create/edit

## Phase 2 — Content Library (toolbox_talks) · epic, expand when reached

- [ ] Seed script: ~30 public-domain OSHA talks with `trade_tag`
- [ ] Server: list / filter-by-trade / search / get
- [ ] Client: browse + trade filter + search + talk detail
- [ ] Custom talks (company-scoped create)
- [ ] Schema: add `user_favorites` table; favorites toggle + filter

## Phase 3 — Offline foundation · epic, design spike first

- [ ] Design doc: IndexedDB schema + sync state machine (reviewed)
- [ ] Add Dexie; tables for meeting_logs, signatures, cached projects/talks
- [ ] Outbound sync queue: enqueue → flush on `online` → set `synced_at`
- [ ] Online/offline indicator; last-write-wins
- [ ] Retro-fit Projects create/edit through the queue

## Phase 4 — Run-a-Talk flow + signatures · epic

- [ ] Supabase Storage buckets (signatures, crew photos) + access rules
- [ ] Meeting wizard: project → talk → present → (TTS + quiz) → signatures → photo → save
- [ ] Canvas finger-signing component
- [ ] Schema: quiz question storage (table or JSONB on toolbox_talks)

## Phase 5 — PDF generation + GC delivery · epic

- [ ] Server PDF service (PDFKit) — generate on sync, store `final_pdf_url`
- [ ] Email PDF to GC (dev transport until paid Mailgun)

## Phase 6 — GC dashboard · epic, blocked by invite/join-company

- [ ] GC views: projects, incoming meeting-log PDFs, per-sub compliance status

## Cross-cutting — Invite / join-company flow · epic, prerequisite for multi-user + Phase 6

- [ ] Admin invites by email; invitee joins an existing `companies` row
- [ ] Real use of `admin` / `safety_manager` roles
- [ ] GC links a sub company to a project (`project_subcontractors`)

## Deferred

- [-] Stripe billing (needs multi-user/site concepts; reconcile `companies.tier` enum first)
- [-] Procore integration
